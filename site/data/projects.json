I designed and programmed a Beat Saber-inspired hand-tracking mode (Meta Start Dev Competition), a multi-lightset baking solution for instant teleport between co-existing environments, and a system to virtualize alien customer behavior (simulation runs even off-screen). I also contributed to polishing (juice/feel) and handled the PlayStation port.",
