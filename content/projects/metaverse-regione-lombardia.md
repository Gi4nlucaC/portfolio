## Overview

Metaverse — Regione Lombardia is a pioneering digital initiative by the Lombardy Region, designed to bring citizens closer to public institutions through immersive technology. This virtual environment allows users to explore interactive digital spaces, participate in events, and discover Lombardy's rich cultural heritage—breaking down physical barriers and enabling new forms of engagement.

Within the Metaverse, users can create personalized avatars, meet others, visit virtual exhibitions, and attend public events. Notably, the platform features a digital recreation of Piazza Città di Lombardia, offering a safe and privacy-respecting space for shared experiences. The debut exhibition, "Incontri nel Metaverso – Tradizioni e saperi lombardi," developed in collaboration with the Archive of Ethnography and Social History (AESS), celebrates the region's traditions and roots through objects and stories.

Launched in December 2024, the Metaverse is accessible via PC, VR headsets, and mobile devices. Participation requires online registration, avatar creation, and time slot selection, ensuring a unique and engaging experience for all. This project marks a new channel of communication between citizens and institutions, leveraging the Metaverse as an innovative tool for cultural and institutional content sharing. Ongoing development aims to further enhance features and performance, making the experience even more engaging in the future.
