## My Role

Served as a **Gameplay Programmer** and **Technical Designer**, acting as the bridge between creative vision and technical implementation. I owned critical parts of the optimization pipeline and led the console certification process.

## Key Technical Contributions

### Systems Architecture & Optimization

- **Runtime Lightmap Swapping:** Architected a custom system to enable a seamless "Endless Mode". This allowed for instant environment changes without scene reloading, maintaining player immersion while managing memory constraints.
- **AI Virtualization:** Engineered an AI Virtualization System to simulate off-screen customer behavior and order generation. This maintained complex game state consistency with minimal CPU overhead.

### Gameplay & Physics

- **Complex Mechanics Prototyping:** Acted as Technical Designer to implement advanced physics interactions, minigames and hand tracking gestures.
- **Localization System:** Built a robust, scalable localization system supporting 5 languages.

### Platform Engineering

- **PlayStation VR Porting:** Owned the full porting and certification pipeline for PlayStation.
- **Certification Success:** Successfully navigated strict **Sony TRC (Technical Requirements Checklist)** standards to ensure a smooth launch on the PlayStation Store.
